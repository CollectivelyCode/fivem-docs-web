Installing FiveM is pretty straightforward. It's usually a matter of [downloading FiveM][home], then simply running the
downloaded file. For those who'd like a bit more detail, read below.

Installing
----------

Running into trouble? Make sure your system meets the [minimum requirements][system-requirements] and
read the [client issues manual][client-issues].

- Disable any antivirus before you download FiveM. Some antivirus vendors like Avast, AVG, and others are
  known to block FiveM procedures, so make sure your antivirus is fully turned off. Once FiveM is installed, add FiveM
  to the whitelist/exclusions of your antivirus. [See here how][antivirus-help]. We're working on a solution.
- Make sure you have installed and updated [GTA V][where-to-buy].
- [Download FiveM][home] off the website.
- Run FiveM.exe. If you run the installer in an empty folder, FiveM will install there. Otherwise, it will install
  in `%localappdata%\FiveM`.
- Start FiveM from your Windows start menu.

Uninstalling
------------

- If you installed FiveM in an empty folder, just delete that folder.
- Otherwise:
    - Press `WinKey+R` on your keyboard
    - Type `%localappdata%` in the dialog that opens
    - Hit Enter
    - Delete the FiveM folder
- That is all you need to do!
- Run FiveM.exe again if you want to reinstall FiveM.
