Here is a list of some of the functions that you can use specifically in **client** side scripts.

Runtime specific functions
--------------------------
Some functions are exclusive to the scripting runtime you're using, and are **not** documented
in the [FiveM Native Reference List](https://runtime.fivem.net/doc/reference.html). Refer to their docs for more detail.

- [Client-side functions in Lua](/docs/scripting-reference/runtimes/lua/client-functions)
- [Client-side functions in JavaScript](/docs/scripting-reference/runtimes/javascript/client-functions)
- [Client-side functions in C#](/docs/scripting-reference/runtimes/csharp/client-functions)

Native functions
----------------
These are native functions provided by both the Citizen framework (under the [CFX](#cfx) heading), as well as by the
game. Clicking each link will lead to the FiveM native reference, where you can see syntax per language, a description,
and examples for using the native.

These natives are usable in **all** runtimes.
